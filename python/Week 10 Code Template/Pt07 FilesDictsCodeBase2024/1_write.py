# In order to read the data stored in a text file, you must open it first. ​

# Just like a book. You can’t read what is inside if you don’t open it first.​

# There are four modes for opening a file:​

# r for only reading files​

# w for only writing to files​ and creating the file if it does not exists but overwrites existing file contents

# a for adding to an existing file​

# r+ for reading and writing files

"""
