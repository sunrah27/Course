"Read data structures and record for 2 minutes"
"""
Data structures are used to store data in an organised and accessible way. 
A list is a data structure.  Another example of a data structure is a record.  
You might have heard of the word record if you have ever created a database before. 


A record allows you to store a collection of attributes for a single entity.
Data structure: record: An entity can be any object, place, person, or thing. 
Attributes are properties or characteristics of that entity.  
Attributes are sometimes referred to as fields.
