# Sequence in programming is a set of instructions performed in order,
# with each executed in turn

"Predict, then Run, and Investigate and modify"

# To DO:
print(2 * 2)   # Predict then Run, and Investigate
print()   # Modify to use a different operator
print()   # Modify to use a different operator
print()  # Make : Use a different number and/or operator

# \n = newline

print("Refactored code\n")
"Predict, then Run, and Investigate"
#To DO: What is dfferent in the terminal when the code below ise executed?
print(2 * 3, "\n", 2 + 3, "\n", 2 / 3, "\n", 21 - 3)

# The python interpreter prints anything as it is, if placed between speech marks/ quotations
print("My name is Abdul\nWelcome to python programming")

print("\nThis is Python Bootcamp")

# format print output
print("The answer to 2 x 3 =", 2 * 3)

#To DO: Exercise: use the print statement to print
# Your name
name = "Shanur Islam"

# Your address
address = "100 Super Valley, London, S27 5OO"
print (name, address)
# Your interests
interests = "Coding, Football, Gym, Anime and Reading"

# format your print function to print your details above in three separate lines
print ("Hi my name is %s. I live at %s and my interests are %s" %(name, address, interests))

# Perform either addition or calculation with two numbers
import math
A = 10
B = 8
C = math.sqrt((A*A) + (B*B))
print ("The hypoteneus of the the triangle with sides %icm and %icm is %0.2fcm." %(A,B,C))

#What is variable in python
#Modify your program to use variables instead of hard coded values 



"Objectives"
"" '' #Variables and Variable naming convention
"" '' #Use meaningful identifiers
"" '' #Determine the need for variables
"" '' #Distinguish between declaration, initialisation, and assignment of variables 
"" '' #Demonstrate appropriate use of naming conventions
